Simplified Chinese HSK 3.0 Vocabulary Entire List. Cards with example sentences, emojis and audio pronunciations. I found a deck on here a while ago with the HSK 2.0 vocabulary. I made a new one from scratch from the official HSK 3.0 PDFs. These cards include on the front the Hanzi and an example sentence in Chinese. Then, on the back it shows the pinyin, the English meaning, and a translation of the example Chinese sentence. Also, there is an emoji that goes along with the meaning of the sentence. AND, there is audio! When the card is flipped, the pronunciation of the Hanzi character is played, followed by a 1 second pause, then a reading of the Chinese sentence. I have practiced with the HSK 2.0 deck for over a year with this same setup (and improved a lot), but I like this one I tried to make it a little more refined and unified. This is my dream Anki deck. The deck is split into 3 sub-decks, one for elementary vocab (1-3), intermediate vocab (4-6) and advanced vocab (7-9) to make it easier to study. I also made it so that the deck adjusts colors for light/dark mode. Hope this helps on your language learning journey, and please let me know on the GitHub issues page I linked if you encounter an error.
